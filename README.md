# Demo Selenium Rust

Demonstration of:

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) browser automation testing
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language
* [Thirtyfour](https://crates.io/crates/thirtyfour/) Selenium WebDriver library for Rust
* [ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver) extends Webdriver by adding Chromium-specific capabilities

Many more examples are here:

## Install

### Install Rust and cargo

Install Rust and cargo from <https://www.rust-lang.org/>

Run this to confirm your version:

```sh
rustc --version
```

Output should be at least:

```stdout
rustc 1.86.0
```

Run this to confirm your version:

```sh
cargo --version
```

Output should be at least:

```stdout
cargo 1.86.0
```

### Install Selenium

Install Selenium WebDriver:

```sh
npm install --save selenium-webdriver@latest
```

### Install chromedriver

Install Google chromedriver:

```sh
npm install --save chromedriver@latest
```

### Update

Run:

```sh
cargo update
cargo add cargo-upgrades
cargo add cargo-edit
cargo upgrade
```

## Run

Run:

```sh
cargo run
```

The script will do three things:

1. Launch your local Chrome web browser to view the free open source testing examples web page <https://testingexamples.github.io>.

2. Interact with the web page in various ways, such as finding elements, clicking on elements, filling in form inputs, etc.

3. Print some typical HTML tag output that demonstrates the program is running successfully.

### Troubleshooting “chromedriver” Not Opened

If you get this kind of error message:

```txt
“chromedriver” Not Opened. Apple could not verify “chromedriver”
is free of malware that may harm your Mac or compromise your privacy.
```

Or this kind of error message:

```txt
Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware that could harm your
Mac or compromise your privacy. Don’t open this unless you are certain it is
from a trustworthy source.
```

Then click "Done".

Try this command line solution:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which chromedriver) 2>/dev/null
```

Try adjusting your system settings:

* Apple menu -> Settings -> Security & Privacy -> General

* See the entry that says: "chromedriver" was blocked to protect your Mac.

* Click the button "Allow Anyway".

### Troubleshooting "This version of ChromeDriver …"

If you get this kind of error message:

```txt
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning:
SessionNotCreatedError: session not created:
This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version …
```

Then you may need to harmonize your Chrome browser app and your Chrome webdriver.

If you use macOS brew, then upgrade chromedriver:

```sh
brew upgrade chromedriver
```

To update your Chrome browser app:

* On your computer, open Chrome.

* Find your current Chrome version by typing in the URL bar: `chrome://version/`.

* You should see a web page with many details, and you should see the first line with the version number, such as: "Google Chrome 135.0.7049.86 (Official Build)".

* At top right, tap the "More" icon, which is 3 vertical dots.

* You see the "More" menu. If you see a menu item "Update", then choose it. If you don't see a menu item "Update", then  you're on the current version.

To update your Chrome webdriver:

* Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

* Download the version that matches your Chrome browser app.
